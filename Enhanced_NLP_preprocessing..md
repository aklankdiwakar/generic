I have a working setup where the user requests for report, we compare the requested report with the existing report using 
nlp_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L12-v2')
all_report_vecs = nlp_model.encode(report_type_list, convert_to_tensor=True)
speech = 'Get me rfc report by customer name, school speciality.'
request_report_vecs = nlp_model.encode(speech, convert_to_tensor=True)
similarity_scores = util.pytorch_cos_sim(request_report_vecs, all_report_vecs)

We have trained the model with the below data 
[("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report Sorted by Customer Name", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Customer Name Based Report", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report Grouped by Customer Name", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Customer Name Report", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Sorted Report by Customer", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report by Name of Customer", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report by Each Customer Name", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report Listing by Customer Name", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Customer Name Wise Report", 1.0),
("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report for Specific Customer Name", 1.0)]


But now the logic is failing when a user requests, "I want the rfc report for Sydney University, starting November 3rd. 1023." The user didn't use the 'customer name' or 'customer' keyword in the requested report, how to handle this case? 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To handle cases where the user’s request does not contain specific keywords like "customer name" or "customer", you can improve your natural language processing (NLP) model's ability to generalize and understand the context. Here are several strategies you can use to handle such cases:

### 1. **Expand Training Data**

Expand your training data to include a wider variety of phrases and synonyms that users might use. This helps the model to generalize better and understand different ways of asking for the same report.

#### Example:
- **Current Training Data:**
  ```python
  training_data = [
      ("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report Sorted by Customer Name", 1.0),
      # ... other entries
  ]
  ```

- **Expanded Training Data:**
  ```python
  training_data = [
      ("Report by Customer Name", "RFC Report Sorted by Customer Name", 1.0),
      ("Customer Name Report", "RFC Customer Name Report", 1.0),
      ("Customer Report", "RFC Customer Name Report", 1.0),
      ("Customer Based Report", "RFC Customer Name Based Report", 1.0),
      ("University Report", "RFC University Report", 1.0),
      ("School Report", "RFC School Report", 1.0),
      ("Organization Report", "RFC Organization Report", 1.0),
      ("Entity Report", "RFC Entity Report", 1.0),
      # ... more variations
  ]
  ```

### 2. **Use Synonym Expansion**

When preprocessing the user’s input, you can replace synonyms with a standard term. This helps to map various terms to a single concept before encoding.

#### Example:
```python
import re

def preprocess_request(speech):
    synonyms = {
        r'customer name': 'customer name',
        r'customer': 'customer name',
        r'university': 'customer name',
        r'school': 'customer name',
        r'organization': 'customer name',
        r'entity': 'customer name',
    }
    for synonym, standard in synonyms.items():
        speech = re.sub(synonym, standard, speech, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return speech

speech = preprocess_request("I want rfc report of Sydney University, starting November 3rd, 1023.")
request_report_vecs = nlp_model.encode(speech, convert_to_tensor=True)
```

### 3. **Contextual Understanding with Transformers**

Leverage the contextual understanding capabilities of transformer models like BERT or Sentence-BERT to better understand the context even when specific keywords are missing.

- **Fine-tune the Model:**
  Fine-tune your SentenceTransformer model with additional training data that includes various ways of requesting reports without specific keywords.

### 4. **Semantic Similarity with Enhanced Preprocessing**

Improve preprocessing to handle more complex sentences and extract relevant entities or keywords. Use libraries like spaCy or NLTK for advanced text processing.

#### Example:
```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_relevant_info(speech):
    doc = nlp(speech)
    entities = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents]
    # Further processing to match report types
    if "university" in speech.lower():
        speech = speech.lower().replace("university", "customer name")
    # Add more replacements as needed
    return speech, entities

speech = "I want rfc report of Sydney University, starting November 3rd, 1023."
processed_speech, entities = extract_relevant_info(speech)
request_report_vecs = nlp_model.encode(processed_speech, convert_to_tensor=True)
```

### 5. **Fallback and Clarification Strategy**

Implement a fallback mechanism to clarify or refine the request if the initial matching fails. Prompt the user for more specific information or use a follow-up question to narrow down the request.

#### Example:
```python
def handle_request(speech):
    processed_speech = preprocess_request(speech)
    request_report_vecs = nlp_model.encode(processed_speech, convert_to_tensor=True)
    similarity_scores = util.pytorch_cos_sim(request_report_vecs, all_report_vecs)
    
    if max(similarity_scores[0]) < threshold:  # Set an appropriate threshold
        return "Could you please provide more details or specify the customer name?"
    else:
        return get_best_matching_report(similarity_scores)

speech = "I want rfc report of Sydney University, starting November 3rd, 1023."
response = handle_request(speech)
print(response)
```

By combining these strategies, you can enhance your system’s robustness and ability to handle diverse user requests, improving the overall user experience and accuracy of report retrieval.
